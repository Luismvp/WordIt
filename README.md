# WordIt
Web application designed to create Word documents based on a group of paragraphs that are backed up in a mySQL DB.

Using this app you will be able to:

-Define some categories which will group your paragraphs.

-Define tags that can be assigned to your paragraphs.

-Write paragraphs to use them to build your documents.

-Filter the paragraphs you introduced in the database using the categories and the tags, in order to make the selection easier.

-Build a Word document using some pre-written paragraphs and images.

If you want to change the format there is an in-code way to alter the font, the size of the images, their position, the size of the font, and also include more elements on the document, as long as you know how to program it.

This project uses the phpWord library and it gives you a way of writting documents that contain almost always the same, but with small changes in a short time. It will enhance your eficiency, and make a normally complicated and boring task something easier.

I encourage everyone who wants to make document building apps to keep on working in this code because the possibilities are huge.
